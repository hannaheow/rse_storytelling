## Public Health + Data 

::: incremental
-   [County Health Rankings & Roadmaps (CHR&R)](https://www.countyhealthrankings.org/health-data)
-   Data -\> Action
-   Broad audience: students, researchers, public health professionals, journalists
-   Lots of places to find similar data: our strengths are our documentation, accessibility, and longevity (since 2011)
-   Members of CHR&R produce podcasts, write research manuscripts, solicit proposals for research grants, and create webinars, among other things!

## "The Rankings"

::: incremental
-   "The Rankings" are an annual [snapshot](https://www.countyhealthrankings.org/health-data/minnesota/olmsted?year=2025) of how counties in the U.S. stack up in terms of health factors and outcomes (life expectancy, access to exercise opportunities, etc.)
-   \~ 3140 US counties
-   \~ 100 measures of health
-   2011 through 2025.5

## Archiving

After July 2026, all CHR&R staff will be let go

After December 2026, the CHR&R website will cease to exist

::: incremental
-   Publish existing projects
-   Move data and documentation to GitHub
-   Find creative ways to use the time and data that we have
:::

## Previous work flow 

::: incremental
-   Primarily SAS

-   Everything stored on the P-drive

-   Every step is done twice (initial calculation, duplication, verification, aggregate calculations, trends)

-   Carefully thought out architecture but inherently inflexible

## New work flow 

::: incremental
-   A work in progress!

-   We're writing what we can in R/quarto and encouraging everyone to contribute even if they are not R users

-   We plan to solicit feedback from non-GitHub users
:::

## Challenges 

::: incremental
-   Keep the good parts without recreating the wheel

-   A lot to learn all at once

-   We need to continue to communicate what's possible without over-selling

-   Tension between what is useful to someone interested in analyzing the data versus someone who only needs their county's demographic profile (for instance)

-   The ease of our "snapshot" cannot be migrated to GitHub

-   Some things will be lost :(
:::

## Opportunities 

::: incremental
-   A big shake up! We would never have made a move like this if not for our funding loss
-   Lots of new skills! (especially great because many of us are on the job market)
-   Our audience is expanding!
-   Discussions tab!
:::

## Lessons learned 

::: incremental
-   Done is better than perfect

-   Leadership and teamwork are important! At CHR&R we are lucky to work with great leadership.

-   One or two team members can make a huge impact
